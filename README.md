# `ring-vector`
Extends [`immutable.Vector`](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/collection/immutable/Vector.html) with ring (circular) methods.

## Need
Whenever data are better described by a circular collection,
chances are you don't want to locally reinvent the wheel ðŸ˜‰.

## Solution
`ring-vector` is a small, self-contained library,
where most of the circular use cases are already solved
and building blocks provided for the others.

One possible idea has been to create a dedicated collection.
But the differences with `Vector` are few,
so a [Scala3 `extension`](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html) seems a better fit.

## Methods

### Circular version of existing ones
Named as their plain non-circular `Vector` versions,
but with an `O` suffix (meaning _ring_).

They are:
* `applyO`
* `segmentLengthO`
* `sliceO`
* `containsSliceO`
* `indexOfSliceO`
* `lastIndexOfSliceO`
* `slidingO`

### Rotation and reflection

### Symmetry
