# ring-vector
Extends immutable `Vector` with ring (circular) methods

## Need


## Solution
One possible idea has been to create a dedicated collection.
But the differences with `Vector` are few, so a Scala3 `extension` seems a best fit.

## Methods

### Overriden

### Rotation and reflection

### Symmetry
